# VulAI

This is really just my attempt at making a suite of tools which run on vulkan and anything using those which I want to be under this organization.
Let's see how it goes! 

# Goals
- [ ] A crate to generate images (Gonna try to make a standalone too somehow?)
- [ ] A crate for talking to LLMs
- [ ] A crate for generating Audio
- [ ] A create for tuning audio (I was thinking of mixing this and generation of audio together?)
- [ ] All of it combined into one thinking bot?
